- This project is a Three.js 3D animation demo using Vite and vanilla JavaScript.
- Follow best practices for modularity, code organization, and asset management.
- All 3D animation logic should be placed in a dedicated module (e.g., `src/animation.js`).
- Use ES modules and keep the main entry point clean and minimal.
- Place all assets (textures, models) in the `public` folder.
- Update the README.md with clear instructions for running and building the project.
